## How It Works

### IP Scanner
The IP Scanner is your go-to tool for mapping out networks. It quickly identifies active devices, open ports, and services, giving you a clear picture of your network's structure. Perfect for administrators and security enthusiasts!

### DoS Testing Tool
This tool lets you simulate various types of Denial-of-Service attacks, including **Death Packets**, **UDP Floods**, and **TCP Floods**. It’s designed to help you test the resilience of your network or systems against potential attacks. Remember, this is for **ethical testing only**!

### Data Grabber
The Data Grabber captures and analyzes network traffic, extracting valuable metadata. It’s a great way to understand what’s happening on your network and identify potential vulnerabilities.
